# Lightcrafter6500DMDControl
LC6500DMD python control

This repository contains an application for controlling the Lightcrafter 6500 dmd in the context of the Lithium Fermi Gas microscope in the lab of Markus Greiner. 

Many low level tools may be useful to those who need to control the LC6500 dmd.


- I (Esmann-P) have made a fork of Mazurenko's Lightcrafter control software, to make pull requests easier.
